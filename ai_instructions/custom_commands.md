This file documents all custom Cypress commands used in this project. For each command, include its purpose, parameters, return type, and usage example.

## How to Use
- Reference this file for available custom commands and their documentation.
- Add new commands here when extending `cypress/support/commands.ts`.

### cy.callSomething
- **Purpose:** Log in as admin and verify dashboard loads.
- **Parameters:** `message: string`
cy.callSomething('Log in as admin and verify dashboard loads').then((response) => {
  // Assert that the response includes cy.visit
  expect(response).to.include('cy.visit');
});
```
- **Best Practice:** Use for admin login workflows to keep tests DRY and readable.


- **Purpose:** Make an authenticated API request and handle the response.
- **Parameters:** `endpoint: string`, `options: object`
  // Assert response status and body
  expect(response.status).to.eq(200);
  expect(response.body).to.have.property('data');
});
```
- **Best Practice:** Always check for error responses and handle them in your tests.


- **Purpose:** Scrolls the page just below the visible fold (viewport).
- **Parameters:** None
cy.scrollBelowFold();
```
- **Best Practice:** Use for visual regression or lazy-loaded content tests.


- **Purpose:** Scrolls to the end (bottom) of the page.
- **Parameters:** None
cy.scrollToEnd();
```
- **Best Practice:** Use for infinite scroll or footer visibility tests.

Add more custom commands below as you create them.
